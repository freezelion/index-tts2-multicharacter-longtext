# IndexTTS2 Emotion Accuracy Debug Test Results

## Test Overview
This test compares emotion generation using the original IndexTTS2 API vs. our multi-character generator to isolate whether emotion accuracy issues stem from our implementation or IndexTTS2's underlying emotion model.

## Test Files Generated

### Original IndexTTS2 Tests
1. **test_tom_angry_vector.wav** (140KB, 3.19s)
   - Method: Direct IndexTTS2 with emotion vector [0.0, 0.95, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
   - Text: "我不想去，我觉得在家看电视更好。"
   - Voice: /media/george/AI/my_share_folder/sample_voice/山山.wav
   - Emotion scaling: Applied 0.95x scaling → [0.0, 0.9025, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

2. **test_tom_angry_descriptive.wav** (160KB, 3.63s)
   - Method: Direct IndexTTS2 with descriptive text "angry: loud and frustrated"
   - Text: "我不想去，我觉得在家看电视更好。"
   - Voice: /media/george/AI/my_share_folder/sample_voice/山山.wav
   - Detected emotion vectors: {'happy': 0.0, 'angry': 0.85, 'sad': 0.02, 'afraid': 0.05, 'disgusted': 0.05, 'melancholic': 0.02, 'surprised': 0.01, 'calm': 0.0}
   - Emotion scaling: Applied 0.95x scaling → [0.0, 0.8075, 0.019, 0.0475, 0.0475, 0.019, 0.0095, 0.0]

### Multi-Character Generator Test
3. **test_emotion_numbers_comparison.wav** (976KB, 20.34s total)
   - Method: Multi-character generator with JSON configuration
   - Contains 6 segments including Tom's angry segment
   - Tom's segment uses same settings: angry 0.95 intensity

## Key Findings

### Emotion Vector Processing
- **IndexTTS2 applies 0.95x scaling automatically**: Even with 0.95 angry intensity, it becomes 0.9025 after scaling
- **Descriptive emotion detection is less precise**: "angry: loud and frustrated" only detected 0.85 angry with mixed emotions
- **Cross-emotion contamination**: Descriptive approach adds small amounts of sad (0.019), afraid (0.0475), disgusted (0.0475)

### Audio Duration Differences
- Vector approach: 3.19 seconds
- Descriptive approach: 3.63 seconds (14% longer)
- This suggests different emotion processing affects speech rate and pacing

## Test Protocol for Listening Comparison

1. **Compare Original vs Multi-Character**:
   - Listen to `test_tom_angry_vector.wav` (pure IndexTTS2)
   - Extract Tom's segment from `test_emotion_numbers_comparison.wav` (multi-character)
   - If both sound wrong → IndexTTS2 emotion model issue
   - If only multi-character sounds wrong → Our implementation issue

2. **Compare Vector vs Descriptive**:
   - Listen to both `test_tom_angry_vector.wav` and `test_tom_angry_descriptive.wav`
   - Determine if direct emotion vectors produce better results than descriptive text

## Conclusion
The test successfully isolated the emotion generation to determine whether accuracy issues are from:
- IndexTTS2's underlying emotion model limitations
- Our multi-character generator implementation
- Emotion vector scaling effects
- Descriptive vs. vector emotion processing differences
