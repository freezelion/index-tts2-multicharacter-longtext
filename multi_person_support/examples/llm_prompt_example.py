In a cozy coffee shop, Emma was working on her laptop when her friend Jake burst in.
"Emma! You won't believe what just happened!" Jake exclaimed, breathless with excitement.
Emma looked up, surprised. "Jake? What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."
"Nothing's wrong! Something's amazing!" Jake grinned, pulling up a chair. "I got the job!"
"The job at the tech company?" Emma asked, her eyes widening.
"Yes! They called me five minutes ago," Jake said, his voice trembling with joy.
Emma jumped up and hugged him. "That's fantastic! I'm so happy for you!"
"Thanks to you for helping me prepare," Jake said sincerely. "Those mock interviews made all the difference."
